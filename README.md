ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LokenderJain
I have a Master's degree in Engineering from BITS, Pilani and a unique background that combines my experience as a developer with my technical writing skills. I have a strong understanding of source code written in languages such as Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript, which allows me to create more accurate and comprehensive documentation for processes and products. I have experience with technical writing tools such as Confluence, Markdown, and Github, and I can quickly learn and adapt to any other tools that may be required.

I have a wide range of industry experience, including working for clients like Apple and Google. I have experience setting up tools and applications for documentation and am skilled at content migration. I am also proficient at creating templates and documentation standards that align with company policies and style guides. In the past three years, I have completed on-site assignments in India, Australia, and the United States.

As a Technical Writer, I specialize in creating documentation for developers and architects building solutions on various platforms. I am skilled at producing and curating content that helps customers understand complex concepts and procedures. In addition, I edit, clarify, and proofread documents written by peers and advise non-writers on ways to improve their writing skills. I work closely with product teams, engineers, content strategists, and other technical writers to ensure that our documentation is accurate, comprehensive, and easy to understand.
